# Image Completion

Implemented a paper from SIGGRAPH 2005 based on OpenCV. Given user specified structure lines, the algorithm removes the object that shields certain structure in the image. A dynamic programming algorithm and a belief propagation algorithm were used to complete line structure.

Based on Ubuntu/Qt/c++/opencv.
